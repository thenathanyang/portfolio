					<p>Hello! My name is Nathan!</p>

					<p>Adventurer. Foodie. Optimist. All-Californian. Bruin.</p>

					<p>The social side of programming is who I am. I'm intrigued by ideas and work that can change how people think and interact with others. I'm currently a Mentor Director at Hacker Fund, an organization aimed to inspire the next generation of technologists, and a committee officer for UCLA ACM Hack, a student organization focused on strengthening the computer science/technology/hacking community at UCLA. My experiences from my extracurricular activities combined with my enjoyment for creating things has translated into my interest in software engineering and contributing to interesting and impactful work.</p>

					<p>In addition to computer science, I enjoy keeping up with current affairs, dancing, and playing tennis, ulitmate frisbee, and the violin.</p>

					<p>If you are interested in learning more about me, feel free to check out my work and <a target="_blank" href="/files/nathanyang-resume.pdf">resume</a> or <a href="/contact">contact</a> me!</p>
