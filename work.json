    "description" : "During the summer of 2014, I spent three weeks in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania at the University of Pensylvania's Summer Academy in Applied Science and Technology (SAAST). At SAAST's computer science program, I was introduced to principles of computer science by studying computational thinking and learning how to program in Python. Throughout the program, I completed various assignments and projects. Unfortunately, I switched computers the year after and lost a decent amount of my code. Some of the projects I was able to find from my time at SAAST are shown below. SAAST has changed its name and is currently known as the Engineering Summer Academy at Penn (ESAP).",
